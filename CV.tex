%% WILLA NOTES
%% Hi Adi!
%% 
%% Here are my thoughts:
%% 
%% The biggest strength of this resume is your research and course experience, 
%% which seem to match perfectly to what the job description is looking for
%% . 
%% You have invested time and energy into machine learning and you have a 
%% passion for learning about how people learn, which seems to make you the 
%% perfect candidate for the job.
%% 
%% The main area for improvement in your resume is to focus your bullets not 
%% only on the work that you did, but also the work's impact. I like to think of 
%% each sentence having three parts. 1. I did stuff 2. on this cool project and 3
%% . it had an impact on my larger community I was working with/organization in 
%% x y and z ways. For you that might be that you carried out the procedure 
%% written by a PI on a specific topic, troubleshooted the tools that you needed 
%% to make that procedure work, and negotiated with the PI for a better solution
%% . The impact could be the results of your analysis, which are leading/have 
%% lead to papers being published.
%% 
%% The second thing that I would think about in your resume is how you can craft 
%% your paper to reflect what the internship wants to see from candidates. You'
%% ve spent a huge amount of time reading and understanding papers. That's one 
%% of the things that seems to be stressed in this job description. Can you 
%% include that experience in your accomplishment statements to show that you're 
%% not only writing code, but also deeply interested in chewing on these awesome 
%% ideas? Maybe consider putting down I read xx number of papers to inform my 
%% understanding of this topic prior to working with PI on experiments, or I am 
%% reviewing xx papers on xx with xx professor. (These are just recommendations 
%% to give you an idea, I know you can craft better bullets than I read x 
%% papers).
%% 
%% Finally, I would recommend replacing your list of courses with a select few 
%% courses and writing in-depth about the projects that you completed in the 
%% course (i.e. did you have a machine learning course that required you to do 
%% independent research in a topic? Was there one where you needed to use neural 
%% networks?) The people reviewing your resume will see your course transcript, 
%% so there's no need to give a complete list of coding courses you've taken. 
%% Just focus on a few courses that seem particularly relevant to this research, 
%% and elaborate on what you actually did.
%% 
%% Overall, the resume looks great! Just adding a bit more can help flush it 
%% out.
%% 
%% Best,
%% Willa

%% JOB DESCRIPTION
%% Join a cross-community movement of learners and researchers collaboratively 
%% learning and crowd-sourcing their machine learning knowledge and expertise to 
%% advance deep learning. We are an interdisciplinary group of researchers at 
%% the University of Michigan, school of information and computer science 
%% department, who have been iteratively developing a large-scale online 
%% collaborative platform. Our platform facilitates knowledge sharing while 
%% getting users involved in large-scale collaborative research. 
%% 
%% The primary focus of our research group is on applications of deep learning 
%% in improving human learning. By joining our research community: 
%% 	•	You’ll gain experience using crucial skills in research (paper 
%%     analysis, summarization, making connections between disciplines). 
%% 	•	Top contributors to our research community would have the opportunity 
%%     to co-author research papers in the field. 
%% 
%% Qualifications
%% 	•	Knowledge and enthusiasm for topics related to machine learning and 
%%     deep learning.
%% 	•	Completion of Coursera machine learning specialization or its 
%%     equivalent on the topics of machine learning or statistical learning.
%% 	•	Experience with implementation of RNN models would be 
%%     preferred.
%% 
%% Responsibilities
%% 	•	Constantly study research papers, summarize them, and share the 
%%     essence of what you learn with our large research team in a 
%%     hierarchically organized fashion.
%% 	•	Implement deep learning models that can help with improving human 
%%     learning.
%% 	•	Attend weekly team meetings on Saturdays 9:00 am – 11:00 am EST to 
%%     discuss the research and present your efforts throughout the week.
%% 	•	Must be prepared and excited to collaborate with our already 
%%     established team of computer scientists, information scientists, 
%%     and statisticians.

\BulletItem Executed an experiment proposed by a collaborating graduate student to determine if recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can learn English syntax from data available to children. 
\BulletItem Collected and processed data from CHILDES (an online database of language children might hear), and removed bugs from the NLTK module used for processing the data, which will streamline future work. 
\BulletItem Trained RNNs on that data, and performed a hyper-parameter search to find best performing models. 
\BulletItem Evaluated the models and found that innate biases may be necessary for RNNs to acquire human language, which provides a direction for further research into creating machine learning systems that generalize as robustly as humans do. 
\BulletItem Wrote a draft of paper with preliminary results. The final version will be submitted for review next year. 
\BulletItem Presented work in lab meetings and to professors of other colleges, which facilitated feedback on new lines of research.
